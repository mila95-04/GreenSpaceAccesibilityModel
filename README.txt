# Green Space Accessibility Model

Python-based geospatial model for classifying accessibility to urban green zones.
Developed in QGIS and Python using GeoPandas, NetworkX, and SciPy.

## Steps
1. Centroid extraction  
2. Direct overlap classification  
3. Buffer model  
4. Network distance model  
5. Final classification

## Outputs
- Classified centroids (GeoJSON)
- Path debug layers
- Distance CSV logs
